# cribbage-strategy

Picking which cards to drop in a cribbage hand is often tricky because of the sheer amount of
possible combinations; you always end up with a mediocre guesstimate at best. Luckily, this is 
simple for a program to calculate

There are several online calculators that can find points in a given hand and maybe give tips, 
but this calculator can do more:

* Take a starting cribbage hand as input
* Calculate the best drop combinations with the highest average points
* Advise the user on other strategies they should take into account beyond just average points 
  (e.g. don't drop a five when you don't have the crib)

If you would like to run this program, the entry point is UserInterface.java in src/main/java/main. Instructions will be provided to the console
