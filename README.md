# cribbage-strategy

Picking which cards to drop in a cribbage hand is often tricky because of the sheer amount of possible combinations; you always end up with a medicre guesstimate at best. Luckily, this is simple for a program to calculate

There are several online calculators that can find points in a given hand and maybe give tips, but this canculator can do more:

* Take a starting cribbage hand as input
* Calculate the best drop combinations with the highest average points
* Advise the user on other strategies they should take into account beyond just average points (e.g don't drop a five when you don't have the crib)

If you would like to run this program, the entry point is UserInterface.java in src/main/java/main. Instructions will be provided to the console
